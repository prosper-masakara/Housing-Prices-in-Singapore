## PREDICTING HOUSE PRICES USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL IN R

Summary

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of linear regression models in predicting housing prices in Singapore. The following research questions guide our analysis:
1.	Which linear regression model is best suited to predict Price_Unit?
2.	How is the model performing in terms of predicted values against actual values?
